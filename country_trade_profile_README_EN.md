# Country Trade Profile

A country's trade profile. The goal is to analyze a country's trade exchanges with the rest of the world.

The data is generated by the notebook [country_trade_profile.ipynb](country_trade_profile.ipynb), which uses the UN Comtrade database.

For a country and a period of interest (within a range of years), it provides:

## 1. Trade Balance
### 1.1. Trade Balance Evolution (Imports and Exports)

Compares the declared value and the symmetric trade value
(e.g., export values aggregated from other countries' import data, and import values aggregated from other countries' export data).

#### Files
* Excel: "reports/[COUNTRY]_1.1_trade_balance_2003-2023.xlsx", e.g.:
[Angola_1.1_trade_balance_2003-2023.xlsx](reports/Angola_1.1_trade_balance_2003-2023.xlsx)
* Chart: "<COUNTRY>_1.2_trade_balance_2003-2023.png", e.g.:
   [reports/Angola_1.2_trade_balance_2003-2023.png](reports/Angola_1.2_trade_balance_2003-2023.png)

## 2. Exports

### 2.1 Main Export Destinations (Clients)

Calculates the export value to the top five (configurable) partner countries in any of the years within the analysis period. For each partner country, the total export value over the period and the percentage of total exports for each year are provided.

> Who are Angola's main clients?

The export value used can be the one reported by the country under analysis or the import values reported by its partners. The mode is configurable in the notebook (variable `report_symmetric`).

The files produced with export values have names ending in `direct` when using the values reported by the country under analysis and `reverse` when using the values reported by the partners.

The notebook can optionally perform a symmetry analysis, comparing the export values with the import values reported by the partners for a specific partner/year.

Based on this data, the following files are produced:

#### Files

 * "reports/[COUNTRY]_2.1.1_top_export_partners_[direct/reverse].xlsx": data retrieved from the UN Comtrade API for the years 2003 to 2023, one row per COUNTRY-PARTNER-YEAR combination.
 * "reports/[COUNTRY]_2.1.2_top_export_partners_cols_[direct/reverse].xlsx": transposed table with years as rows and partners as columns. For each partner, two columns are provided: export value and percentage of total exports for the year.
 * "reports/[COUNTRY]_2.1.3_export_top_5_partners_2003-2023_[direct/reverse].xlsx": simplified version of the previous file, only including countries that were among the top five partners in any of the years.
 * A chart showing the evolution of exports with the main countries: "reports/<COUNTRY>_2.1.4_export_partners_2003-2023_[direct/reverse].png".
 * Optionally, a chart comparing the exports declared by the country under analysis with the imports reported by the partner for a specific year: "reports/<COUNTRY>_2.1.5_export_import_symmetry_2008.xlsx".

### 2.2 Main Exported Products

Value of exports for the top five (configurable) products exported in any of the years within the analysis period.

> What are Angola's main exports?

The export value is based on the imports reported by the partners (mode `reverse`) (it is possible to alternatively use the export values reported by the country under analysis: mode `direct`).

The reported values are aggregated by HS-AG6 (6-digit detail level, as in World Bank reports, configurable). Compare with World Bank, WITS, e.g.: [https://wits.worldbank.org/countrysnapshot/en/AGO](https://wits.worldbank.org/countrysnapshot/en/AGO).

After aggregation, the top five products exported in any of the years within the analysis period are identified.

For each product, the total export value over the period and the percentage of total exports for each year are provided.

#### Files

* "reports/[COUNTRY]_2.2_exports_products_HS-AG6-2003-2023_[direct/reverse].xlsx", e.g.: [reports/Angola_2.2_exports_products_HS-AG6-2003-2023.xlsx](reports/Angola_2.2_exports_products_HS-AG6-2003-2023.xlsx)

### 2.3 Main Exported Products and Main Clients

Main *destinations/clients* of the main *products*.

> Who buys Angola's oil?

For each year, the top five destinations of the most exported products are identified.

For each product, the total export value to the top five (configurable) buyers and the percentage of each partner in the total exports of that product for that year are provided.

This data allows analyzing the evolution of the destinations of the main exported products.

#### Files

* [COUNTRY]_2.3_exports_products_partners_HS-AG6-2003-2023_[direct/reverse].xlsx

### 2.4 Main Clients and Main Exported Products

Main *products* sold to the main clients.

For each year, the top five clients of the country's exports are identified, along with the top five products purchased by these clients.

This data allows analyzing the composition of exports to the largest clients and their diversification or concentration.

> What does China buy from Angola (besides oil)?

#### Files
* [COUNTRY]_2.4_exports_partners_products_HS-AG6-2003-2023_[direct/reverse].xlsx

### 2.5 Alternative Suppliers for Exported Products

For each partner country importing one of the most exported products, alternative suppliers for that product are identified, and the ranking of the country under analysis within the set of suppliers is calculated.

This data allows analyzing the importance of the country under analysis as a source of supply for its trade partners.

> Besides Angola, who else supplies oil to China, and what is Angola's ranking among the suppliers?

#### Files
* [COUNTRY]_2.5.1_export_partners_alternative.xlsx: all alternative suppliers for all main products exported by the country of interest.
* [COUNTRY]_2.5.2_export_partners_alternative_relevant.xlsx: subset of the previous listing, only including rows related to the country under analysis when the ranking among suppliers is 25 or lower (configurable).

## 3. Imports

### 3.1 Main Origins of Imports (Suppliers)

For each year, the main countries supplying the main imported products during the analysis period are identified. This allows analyzing the evolution of the country's main suppliers over time.

#### Files

* "[COUNTRY]_3.1.1_top_import_partners.xlsx": data retrieved from the UN Comtrade API, one row per COUNTRY-PARTNER-YEAR combination.
* "[COUNTRY]_3.1.2_top_import_partners_cols.xlsx": simplified table with years as rows and partners as columns. For each partner, two columns are provided: import value and percentage of total imports for the year.
* "[COUNTRY]_3.1.3_import_top_5_partners_2003-2023": simplified version of the previous file, only including countries that were among the top five partners in any of the years.

### 3.2 Main Imported Products

*Products*: value of imports for the top five (configurable) products imported during the analysis period.

> What are Angola's main imported products?

The import value is reported by the country under analysis or by the exports of its partners.

The reported values are aggregated by HS-AG6 (6-digit detail level, as in World Bank reports, configurable). After aggregation, the top five products imported in any of the years within the analysis period are identified. For each product, the total import value over the period and the percentage of total imports for each year are provided.

### 3.5 Alternative Clients of Main Suppliers

For the main suppliers of the country under analysis, analyze, for the products supplied, which other clients the suppliers have and calculate the relative position of the country under analysis among the main clients of the suppliers.

This data allows analyzing the extent to which suppliers depend on Angola as a client.

> Who else do the USA sell oil exploration equipment to, and what is Angola's position among their clients?

#### Files
* [COUNTRY]_3.5.1_import_partners_alternative.xlsx: all alternative clients of the suppliers of the main imports of the country under analysis.
* [COUNTRY]_3.5.2_import_partners_alternative_relevant.xlsx: subset of the previous listing, only including rows related to the country under analysis when the ranking among clients is 25 or lower (configurable).

## Notes

[^1]: For Angola, results match [https://trendeconomy.com/data/h2/Angola/TOTAL](https://trendeconomy.com/data/h2/Angola/TOTAL) for AG2 and AG4 but not [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1143152/value-of-imports-into-angola-by-category/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1143152/value-of-imports-into-angola-by-category/) and are close but not identical to [https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/angola/tradestats](https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/angola/tradestats). The imports mostly match World Bank WITS data, but in some years, there seems to be a mismatch of HS Codes, with different descriptions in WITS and values that sometimes match AG4 and not AG6 (2015, total is AG4:2710 not AG6:271012) and in some cases match the first 5 digits (2015: 73042 "Casings tubing...", 2021 10011, Durum Wheat).
